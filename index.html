    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral (Slate, Stone, Amber) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based dashboard. Top navigation filters pods by major category (Wellness, Content, etc.). The main view displays pods as interactive cards. Clicking a card expands it to show detailed member and project info. This progressive disclosure approach simplifies complex information and creates an intuitive, task-oriented user flow. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Pod hierarchy -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Viz: Interactive tabbed layout with expandable cards -> Interaction: Click to filter categories, click to expand cards -> Justification: Best method for navigating hierarchical text data without traditional charts. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation, Tailwind CSS for layout and styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
