    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral (Slate, Stone, Amber) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-part, single-page dashboard. Part 1 visualizes the 5 Guilds of the Business District using large sections. Within each Guild, 'Warbands' are presented as expandable cards for progressive disclosure. Part 2 displays the 3 Business Cohorts as a clear vertical progression. This structure mirrors the source doc's hierarchy, making a complex system easily navigable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Hierarchical organizational structure -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz/Presentation Method: Interactive SPA with expandable cards (accordion pattern) and tiered sections -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse details -> Justification: Best for presenting dense, nested textual information without overwhelming the user. Avoids unnecessary charts for non-quantitative data. -> Library/Method: Vanilla JS for DOM manipulation, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
